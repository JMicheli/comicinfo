# ComicInfo.xml

## What is it?

The `ComicInfo.xml` file originates from the ComicRack application, which is not developed anymore. The `ComicInfo.xml` however is used by a variety of applications.

There is, however, no governance about the file format, until now!

This project aims at:
1. documenting the existing versions of the schema, with the accepted usage of each field
2. centralizing evolutions of the schema
